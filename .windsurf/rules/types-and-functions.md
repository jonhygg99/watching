1. Use class modifiers to control if your class can be extended or used as an interface.
2. Type annotate variables without initializers.
3. Type annotate fields and top-level variables if the type isn't obvious.
4. Annotate return types on function declarations.
5. Annotate parameter types on function declarations.
6. Write type arguments on generic invocations that aren't inferred.
7. Annotate with `dynamic` instead of letting inference fail.
8. Use `Future<void>` as the return type of asynchronous members that do not produce values.
9. Use getters for operations that conceptually access properties.
10. Use setters for operations that conceptually change properties.
11. Use a function declaration to bind a function to a name.
12. Use inclusive start and exclusive end parameters to accept a range.
