description: When importing files
---

1. Don't import libraries inside the `src` directory of another package.
2. Don't allow import paths to reach into or out of `lib`.
3. Prefer relative import paths within a package.
4. Don't use `/lib/` or `../` in import paths.
5. Consider writing a library-level doc comment for library files.
